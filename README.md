# Conversion Tool: Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal

A simple, interactive tool for converting between **Binary**, **Octal**, **Decimal**, and **Hexadecimal** number systems, implemented in C. This project is perfect for learning about number systems and their inter-conversions while practicing C programming concepts.

## Features

- Convert **Decimal to Binary** and **Binary to Decimal**
- Convert **Decimal to Octal** and **Octal to Decimal**
- Convert **Hexadecimal to Binary** and **Binary to Hexadecimal**
- Clear, user-friendly terminal interface with a menu-driven system
- Proper memory management for dynamically allocated strings

## Demo

The program runs as a console-based tool, allowing you to choose the type of conversion you want from the menu.

```bash
Conversion Tool Menu:
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Decimal to Octal
4. Octal to Decimal
5. Hexadecimal to Binary
6. Binary to Hexadecimal
7. Exit
Enter your choice:
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., `gcc` for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows).

### Compilation

To compile the program, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
gcc -o conversion_tool main.c
```

### Usage

Once compiled, you can run the program using:

```bash
./conversion_tool
```

After launching the tool, you can enter the menu choice to perform the desired number system conversion. The program will guide you through the process with prompts for input.

## Code Overview

The code is organized into different conversion functions:

- `decimalToBinary(int decimal)`: Converts a decimal number to binary.
- `binaryToDecimal(const char[] binary)`: Converts a binary number to decimal.
- `decimalToOctal(int decimal)`: Converts a decimal number to octal.
- `octalToDecimal(const char[] octal)`: Converts an octal number to decimal.
- `hexadecimalToBinary(const char[] hex)`: Converts a hexadecimal number to binary.
- `binaryToHexadecimal(const char[] binary)`: Converts a binary number to hexadecimal.

Each function uses string manipulation and bitwise operations to perform the conversions efficiently.

### Memory Management

- **Dynamically Allocated Memory**: The program uses `malloc` to allocate memory for conversion strings. Make sure to free the allocated memory after its use to avoid memory leaks.
